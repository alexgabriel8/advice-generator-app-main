## The challenge

The user can click on a die to trigger a script that consults an API for a piece of advice and shows it on the page that is responsive on any device.

### Challenge requirements

In this challenge, I had to:

- Match the page as closely as possible to the provided design
- Make the page responsive
- Have hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice everytime the dice icon is clicked
